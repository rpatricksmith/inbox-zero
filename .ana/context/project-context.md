*How is the codebase organized and why? What are the layer boundaries?*

## Where to Make Changes

*Common tasks and where to find the relevant code. What files are entry points for what kind of work?*

## Key Decisions

*Technology choices and patterns that look wrong but are intentional. What was tried and rejected?*

## Key Files

- Database schema: `apps/web/prisma/schema.prisma`
- Deployment config: `apps/web/vercel.json`
- CI pipeline: `.github/workflows/ai-evals.yml`, `.github/workflows/api-release.yml`, `.github/workflows/build-changelog.yml` + 9 more

*Add: database client location, auth config, AI wrapper, shared types, test helpers.*

## What Looks Wrong But Is Intentional

*Patterns that seem wrong for this stack but are deliberate. Anti-intuitive decisions with rationale.*

## Active Constraints

*Current priorities. Areas under active refactoring. Features not to touch right now.*

## Domain Vocabulary

*Terms with project-specific meaning. E.g., "workspace" = pnpm workspace package, not Slack workspace.*
